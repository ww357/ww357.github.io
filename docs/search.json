    "text": "categories: [Machine Learning][Maps]\nI have spent some time over the past few months working with MapReader; a convolution neural network (CNN) put together by researchers at the University of Exeter and the Alan Turing Institute trained on and aimed at improving our ability to process historic maps efficiently and at scale. Aimed at being accessible to non-technical researchers, it opens the door to some really exciting new understandings about changes over time documented in historic maps.\nFor my research it’s an exciting tool because it can help us more easily study the large-scale loss of hedgerows in Britain which has had unforeseen negative effects on food security, drought and flooding resistance, green carbon storage and biodiversity. Computer vision approaches to historic map processing have been used for around 40 years, but this is the first time a complex, machine learning model like this has been developed exclusively for this task.\n\nAbove is a map sheet from one of the Ordinate Survey’s early mapping campaign of England (~1900), …"

    "section": "",
    "text": "In an early attempt to try using machine learning models for spatial data analysis of ecological processes, I put together a rudimentary model that clusters arthropod observation data to compare the location of larger communities to the quality of hedgerow in their surrounding landscape. In hind sight, after reading this paper and talking with my supervisor I realized the methodology fails to fully account for the importance of scale differences in such an ecological relationship, but it was still fascinating to observe clear similarities between the presence of larger, healthier hedgerows around bigger populations of endangered butterflies. If the results from this study stand true, the importance of hedgerows for macro-scale distribution of beneficial arthropod species may now more frequently depend on the quality of hedgerows in their environment rather than a close proximity to natural habitat land cover. This would primarily be because of how little of these habitats are left rather than the the ability of hedgerows to act as a surrogate in their absence.\nHere is the preliminary figure exploring the extent of my dataset compiled using Python in ArcGIS Pro and VScode. The observation data was pulled from iNaturalist using it’s API and the hedgerow data was derived by Broughton et al. (2021) who took advantage of open-source, fine-resolution LiDAR data covering much of Britain’s South West Peninsula.\n\nI clustering the observations with a density-based spatial clustering algorithm (DBSCAN) to identify distinct communities across the peninsula and then ran Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient to try and statistically identify if there was a relationship between community sizes and the lengths of different hedgerow high classes (their height’s have a well-understood correlation to their width and quality as habitats). Here are the results:\n\nUnsurprisingly, the healthier the hedgerow, the more likely it is to support larger insect communities, but what was more surprising is the final row of that table. I similarly measured the quantity of natural habitat around each observations to compare it as a variable in the model, yet surprisingly there was suitability no correlation to larger species communities. Because the measuring of this variable (as an area) differed from how hedgerow was measured (as lengths) I think this result highlighted the issue I previously mentioned with the model.\nI am going to continue working on this approach to better our understanding of the ecological importance of hedgerows, adding more species into the model, adjusting parameters to best capture the relationships and by making sure correlations to landscape features are more realistically assessed.\nPaper mentioned:\nBroughton, R.K., Chetcuti, J., Burgess, M.D., Gerard, F.F. and Pywell, R.F.

    "section": "",
    "text": "I am putting together a new approach to managing the restoration of hedgerows in actively cultivated fields using a computer vision model that identifies change from early 20th century Ordinate Survey maps (second edition, six-inch map series). What makes it ‘field-level’ is the use of a relatively new dataset produced by researchers working with the UK Center for Ecology & Hydrology that is produced to map information of the crop production for individual fields (source to the data). I have essentially cookie-cuttered out chunks of the old maps using the polygons from this dataset to act as individual images into a convolution neural network (CNN). I have managed to condense the entire process into a single-document pipeline that goes through every step of:\n\nQuerying the Library of Scotland’s database of historic OS maps (using MapReader Python package)\nDownloading these maps onto the computer’s hard drive (Using MapReader)\nGeoreferencing them based on corner coordinates (using GDAL library)\nJoining maps into one large raster(GDAL)\nNot in pipeline yet: splitting the raster by the polygons of the Crop Plus data.\nLoad in individual patches produced in raster split into MapReader’s annotation tool.\nTrain ResNet-18 (pre-trained on OS maps by Houssini et al., 2023) CNN\n\nHere is a visualisation of this pipeline:\n\n\nResults:\nHere are the county-level results after bad predictions were omitted and the Yorkshire study site was removed (predictions were entirely incorrect):\n\nI then did some analysis on the difference between the size of fields that had and had not experienced hedgerow loss, and he difference between arable vs pastoral fields. The results (below) were as expected, with the largest fields experiencing hedgerow loss because of their dilation by removing boundaries, whiile arable farmland experienced greater instances of hedgerow loss. The latter was expected because arable land is more prone to expansion for bigger fields that can be managed more easily by bigger machinery. These findings were less about making testing these prior assumptions, and more about seeing if the model’s predictions aligned with them for verification of success.\n\nAfter these results were obtained, I broadcasted the resulting predictions onto the polygon features to visualise the results in ArcGIS Pro. I will publish this as an interactive map in due course.\n\n\nAppendix (table of finer details of the county-level results):"
